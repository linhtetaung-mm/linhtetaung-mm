"A Little About Me"

My name is Lin Htet Aung. I live in Mandalay city. A third year ECE student at MIIT(Myanmar Institute of Information Technology).

Academic years are still waiting for me but for a certain reason I can't go to school yet. So I am doing what I enjoy most and that is coding.

I like puzzles and good at playing too...especially about games on numbers and patterns.

Some games I wrote myself are - Crack Code Puzzle(game website and solving algorithm), Fill One-line puzzle(solving algorithm).
