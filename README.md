## ðŸ”¹ A Little About Me  
Hi, I'm Lin Htet Aung, currently living in Mandalay City. I spend my time doing unnecessary things, and, well... nothing much happens. ðŸ˜‘  

Academic years are still waiting for me, but for certain reasons, I haven't gone back to school yet. In the meantime, I'm doing what I enjoy mostâ€”**coding**.  

I love puzzles, and I'm pretty good at solving them tooâ€”especially those involving numbers and patterns.
