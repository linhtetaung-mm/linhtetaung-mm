"A Little About Me"

Hi, I'm Lin Htet Aung. Living in Mandalay City. Doing unnecessary things and nothing happening...ðŸ˜‘

Academic years are still waiting for me but for a certain reason I can't go back to school yet. So I am doing what I enjoy most and that is coding.

I like puzzles and good at playing them too...especially with games in numbers and patterns.

Some game-solving algorithms I wrote myself are - Crack Code Puzzle(game webpage and solving algorithm), Fill One-line puzzle(solving algorithm) and Slider Numbers puzzle(solving Algorithm).

All these three puzzles can be found on https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psp.brainmindgames&gl=US
